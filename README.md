# Solana Flash Loan Arbitrage

A cloud-based development environment for building flash loan arbitrage bots on Solana. No local setup required - everything runs in your browser.

## What it does

This project helps you:
- Find price differences between Solana DEXs (Jupiter, Raydium, Orca)
- Execute flash loans to profit from arbitrage opportunities
- Develop and test strategies without installing anything locally

## Quick Start

### Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)
1. Click the green "Code" button above
2. Select "Codespaces" tab
3. Click "Create codespace on main"
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for automatic setup
5. Start coding in VS Code (in your browser)

### Option 2: Other Cloud Platforms
- Replit: Good for beginners - [replit.com](https://replit.com)
- Gitpod: Advanced features - [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io)

## What you get

- Rust 1.86.0 - Programming language for Solana
- Solana CLI 1.18.26 - Command line tools
- Anchor 0.31.0 - Framework for building Solana programs
- **Pre-configured VS Code** - Ready-to-use development environment

## Basic Usage

```bash
# Verify everything is installed
rustc --version
solana --version
anchor --version

# Create a new project
anchor init my-arbitrage-bot
cd my-arbitrage-bot

# Build and test
anchor build
anchor test
```

└── .devcontainer/     # Cloud environment configuration
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Code** - Write your arbitrage logic
2. **Test** - Run tests on devnet (fake Solana network)
3. **Deploy** - Deploy to devnet for testing
4. **Monitor** - Watch for arbitrage opportunities
5. **Execute** - Run your bot (carefully!)

## Important Notes

⚠️ This is for educational purposes. Flash loan arbitrage involves financial risk.

- Always test on devnet first
- Start with small amounts
- Understand the risks before using real money
- Check local regulations
